## "Mountain-Matcher"

#### This is a personal Ruby on Rails project I've embarked upon since completing the Makers Academy Course. 

###The Concept:
Many websites exist for ski and board holidays, yet researching and choosing a resort to visit is *still* a laborious task. Most of the dates are outdated with poor styling and user interfaces. There's a wealth of information out there but it's hidden amongst  a labyrinth of links! 

I aim to create a site holding information on European resorts in a simple and user-friendly, sexy format. 

First deployment will be simple with a comparison table and individual resort pages. 

###Areas to develop:
+ Adding search/filter ability
+ Embedding cookies to enable affiliate referrals
+ Responsive design
+ Enable user rating for things such as Apres Ski rating
+ Enable resort suggestions based on groups 
+ Build online presence - twitter


###Aim of the project:
Initially this project is to help develop my Ruby and RoR skills, a language and framework I love. i also want to learn more about UX and design, particularly responsive design.

Ultimately though I'd like this to become the de facto ski-resort search site and eventually monetise through affiliate links to ski holiday providers. 

###Technologies used and lessons learned:
+ PostgreSQL
+ JQuery
+ TableSorter Gem
+ Slugging URLS (i.e removing index reference)
+ CSS3 / HTML5
